name: fixdata
description: Correct a mistake in the Tibetan vocabulary data — a wrong gloss, romanization, category, note, or false-friend pairing — and regenerate the app's JSON. Use when the user reports an error in the dictionary or spreadsheet, says a word's meaning is wrong, or asks to fix or change an existing entry.
---

# /fixdata — correct existing vocabulary entries

Corrections go through `tools/edit_entries.py`, which writes a **new dated
version** of the workbook. The previous version is never edited, and `entry.id`
never changes, so review progress in localStorage survives every correction.

---

## Why not just edit the spreadsheet by hand

**A gloss is stored in more than one place.** `དེ་` carries its English in its own
row, and every *other* row that lists དེ་ as a related word or a false friend
repeats that gloss in its own paired column. Fixing the headword by hand leaves
the copies stale, and the Look up chips go on showing the old meaning — a silent
inconsistency that nothing will flag.

`regloss` rewrites all of them in one operation and prints every change.

---

## Steps

### 1. Find the true extent of the mistake

Before writing anything, find **every** place the wrong text appears.

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import json
d = json.load(open('tibetan_trainer_data.json', encoding='utf-8'))
WORD = 'དེ་'          # the headword being corrected
for e in d['entries']:
    if e['tibetan'] == WORD:
        print('HEADWORD', e['id'], repr(e['english']))
    for kind in ('related', 'falseFriends'):
        for it in e[kind]:
            if it['tibetan'] == WORD:
                print(f"  {e['id']:9} {kind:12} = {it['english']!r}")
PY
```

Report the full list to the user before changing it. A correction that looks like
one cell is usually six.

### 2. Confirm the exact wording

Users describe corrections in shorthand — "DE means that but NOT those". Do not
guess the replacement text. Confirm the exact string, and ask whether related
entries are affected too. Watch for entries that are *correctly* different:
`དེ་དག་` legitimately means "those (plural)" and must not be swept up in a fix to
`དེ་`.

### 3. Write the edits file

```json
[
 {"op": "set",     "id": "TIB1-019", "english": "that"},
 {"op": "regloss", "tibetan": "དེ་", "from": "that; those", "to": "that"},
 {"op": "unlink",  "id": "NEC-026", "column": "falseFriends", "tibetan": "དེ་"}
]
```

**Always pass `from` on a regloss.** It restricts the rewrite to cells whose gloss
matches exactly, and the tool reports every cell it skipped. Without it you can
silently overwrite wording that was deliberately different.

`set` accepts any column by short name; `related` and `falseFriends` take pair
lists and replace the whole column. Full reference in the script's docstring.

### 4. Dry run, then apply

```bash
python3 tools/edit_entries.py --edits fixes.json --dry-run   # prints every before/after
python3 tools/edit_entries.py --edits fixes.json
python3 tools/import_dictionary.py
```

Read the dry run properly. The `!!` lines list cross-references left alone
because they did not match `from` — check each one is genuinely already correct
rather than differently wrong.

### 5. Check the false-friend groups did not shift

Only needed when a correction touches the `falseFriends` column, but cheap:

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import json, subprocess
old = json.loads(subprocess.run(['git','show','HEAD:tibetan_trainer_data.json'],
                                capture_output=True, text=True).stdout)
new = json.load(open('tibetan_trainer_data.json', encoding='utf-8'))
sig = lambda d: {tuple(sorted(g['members'])): (g['romanizationsIdentical'],
                                               g['hideRomanizationOnPrompt'])
                 for g in d['falseFriendGroups']}
o, n = sig(old), sig(new)
print('groups', len(o), '->', len(n))
print('identical-romanization', sum(v[0] for v in o.values()), '->', sum(v[0] for v in n.values()))
print('unchanged:', o == n)
PY
```

False friends are edges in a graph and the groups are its connected components,
so **removing** an edge can split a group and **adding** one can merge two. A
merge that collapses an identical-romanization group destroys the most valuable
card type in the app — see `README_DATA.md`. If the count moved, say so and
explain which groups changed.

### 6. Verify and report

Confirm zero stale references remain (re-run the step-1 query), then serve the
app and check Look up renders the corrected entry. Report:

- every cell changed, old → new
- anything the `from` guard skipped
- any group-structure change
- the new workbook filename, and that the previous one is untouched

Do not commit unless the user asks.

## Housekeeping

Each run adds a dated workbook. Several in one day is normal while iterating —
the format is `YYYYMMDD HHMM …` after the first of the day. Intermediate versions
that were never committed can be deleted; suggest it rather than doing it.
